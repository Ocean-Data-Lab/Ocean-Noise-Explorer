OOIPY is a python toolbox designed to aid in scientific analysis
of Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) data. Some data (such as
broadband hydrophone data) is not available through the OOI API
(M2M). This package is designed to help with the acquiring of
datasets from the OOI Raw Data Server. Additionally, tools to
analyze the data, such as spectrogram and power spectral density
plotting are also provided.

Ocean Data Lab at the University of Washington has developed Ocean Noise Explorer (ONE), 
a web-based interactive ocean soundscape that will enable users to visualize and explore 
a wide variety of underwater noise metrics and other related data products. 
The raw data used in this project is collected by the Regional Cabled Array and the 
Coastal Endurance Array of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). 
The raw data is processed by OOIPY, a Python library developed by our team,
to calculate different data products that are required for a comprehensive ocean soundscape analysis.
